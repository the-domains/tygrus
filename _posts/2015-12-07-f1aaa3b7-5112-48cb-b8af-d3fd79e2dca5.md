Tygrus is an environmental technology company that provides flexible industrial waste stream and water remediation systems. Tygrus also produces new generation chemical products that can reduce the use of hazardous chemicals worldwide.

Tygrus Waste Stream Remediation Systems utilize proprietary material ionizing  transformation technologies that process waste streams for the mining industry, municipal water companies, oil and gas recovery, and industrial hazardous waste stream management.

Our chemical products, Tydronium(tm) and Tydroxide,(tm) are stable hydronium extract hydrates that have similarities to extreme acids and bases, but differ in that they are nontoxic, noncorrosive, environmentally friendly, and safe for human touch.

Our mission is to better everything. With our systems and products, we are able to improve water quality, remediate hazardous waste streams, reduce the use of hazardous chemicals, enhance food safety, eliminate preservatives in the personal care industry, and provide healthier cleaning products.
